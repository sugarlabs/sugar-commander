What is this?
=============

Sugar-commander is an Activity for the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project. It lets you import items from removeable devices
like USB drives and SD cards using a familiar hierarchical view of files on these devices, as opposed to the
flattened and IMHO misleading "Journal" view that the Sugar Journal gives to these devices. It also enables you to
see how much disk space each Journal entry uses, generates thumbnails, and does other things to enhance your
use of the Journal.

How to use?
===========

Sugar-commander is part of the Sugar desktop.  Please refer to;
